### Whatsapp couple conversation analyzer

#### Why? 
Short weekend project aimed at buidling a python class to draw quick and meaninfull statistics about my partner and I whatsapp conversation. 
Current solutions offer even more basic analysis, where metrics measured are more directed toward group of friends conversations.

#### How to use it?
- Clone the project
- Follow the tutorial in the jupyter notebook
- Have fun! 

#### Limitations
- Primarily focused on conversations for couples at the moment.
- French language supported by default, possible to switch to english, italian or any other nltk supported language by changing the language setting (cf tutorial)

#### Would be nice to have in the future...
- a nice Dash visualization
- Tests (always)
- sentiment analysis (I could not find a free and good working french sentiment analyser, the ones I tested didn't give good results)
- favourit emojies analysis
- support for larger group conversation - not difficult but a bit more work and not in my interest at the moment.

Make good use of it if you do ;)
